## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design

### What I learned

This is my first project working with TTF files, which is a new and valuable experience. I also solidified my knowledge of using shadows on boxes.

### Continued development

Instead of the HTML /<br> tag, I used margins to add line breaks in the paragraph. Margins are a better option than the /<br> tag when talking about responsiveness, but I think it should be a better solution, so I will continue to try the other options.
